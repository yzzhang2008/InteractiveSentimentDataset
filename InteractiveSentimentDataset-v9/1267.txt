B : I'm not sure. It's making a lot of strange noises. -1
A : That's weird. It's not even an old car. -1

A : He doesn't know? What is he doing then? 0
B : Trying all different things. I'm getting tired of waiting for him to fix it. -1
A : You should take it to another mechanic. 0
B : I should, but I already paid him. He just keeps saying he will fix it. -1
A : He doesn't sound very trustworthy. -1
B : I know. I should've gone somewhere else. But he was so cheap. He was the cheapest I could find. 1
A : Maybe too cheap isn't always better. -1
B : I'm learning that now. -1
A : You should demand a refund. 0
B : I wish I could, but it's a little complicated. -1
