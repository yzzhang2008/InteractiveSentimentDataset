B : Not very well. -1
A : Why? Looks like you're feeling very down! What happened? -1
B : Nothing. 0
A : Come on. For a man who's feeling so down, there're usually two reasons. Either his career is going downhill, or he has a broken heart. Since you're so successful, it must be the other. 1

A : Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you two were made for each other. -1
B : Well, you never know. I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down, but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young. -1
A : Well, you can't blame her. It's always difficult to choose between career and family. 0
B : Maybe you're right. 0
A : Jack, I don't know what to say to comfort you, but cheer up! There's plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate, your perfect match! 0
B : Yeah, but it's hard to forget her at the moment. You know, we were together for almost five years. It's really hard.... -1
