A : B, you look bushed. Didn't you get a good night's sleep? -1
B : Nope. John kept me awake all last night. -1
A : Oh!? -1

A : My grandpa used to do the same thing. Sometimes he would even wake himself up. He snored so loud! I always thought it was funny. 1
B : Well, I'm certainly not laughing about John. I don't think I can take another night like that again. -1
A : Have you considered buying some earplugs? 0
B : You bet! In fact, I'm going to buy some at lunch! -1
