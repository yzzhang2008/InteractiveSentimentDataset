A : Hi, I’m Mariko’s mother. How are you? 0
B : Fine, thank you. Nice to meet you, please have a seat. Just give me a moment to find her file. 1
A : I received Mariko’s report card yesterday. Generally it seemed O.K. I'm happy to see that see is doing well at school; however, I found her science marks were below average. So I was hoping to discuss that with you. 0
B : Mariko is a wonderful child. It is a real pleasure having her in my class this year. I try to teach the children that science can be fun. It’s hard for them to fully understand every concept we cover. At this age they are all growing and developing so fast, sometimes they just need a little extra time. Mariko has been struggling with understanding some concepts, but she is a hard worker and I am sure she will be fine. 1
A : I see. Then how can I help her? Do you have any suggestions? 0
B : I will send her science duo-tang (link is external) home with her after the every science class so you will know exactly which units she learned at school. If she doesn’t understand some parts of it, you can explain that to her in Japanese or English. You may wish to consider some extra help, perhaps a tutor or after school program. There’s also a wide range of resources on the Internet today. Many people speak very highly of Khan Academy (link is external), it is a non profit organization that produces online educational content. 0
A : Thank you for your advice. 1
B : You’re very welcome. 1
