A : Do you know where I can buy a new dishwasher? 0
B : I think the home improvement store is having a big sale this weekend. Is your dishwasher broken? 0
A : Yeah. I need to replace it. 0
B : Have you tried to repair it? 0
A : Yeah, we called a repairman yesterday. He said that it would cost more to repair than to replace it. 0
B : Wow. At least he was honest about it. 1
A : I know. I appreciated that. We really can't afford to buy a new one right now. We just had a baby a couple of months ago. But I really need one. -1
B : That's right. You had a baby not too long ago. Why don't you buy a used one? 0
A : Where can I get a used one that's in good condition? 0
B : I actually have a friend who is selling hers. She said there isn't anything wrong with her current one. She just wants a different color. Her current one is white. 0
A : I don't care what color it is. I just want one that works well. Do you know how much it is? 1
B : I don't know. Let me call her right now. -1
A : Thanks. I'll talk to my husband too. He may not want a used one. He's a little picky about appliances. -1
B : Ok. Let me know if he's interested. 1
