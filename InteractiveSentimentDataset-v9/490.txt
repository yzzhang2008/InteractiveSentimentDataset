A : What time do you usually get there? 0
B : Just a few minutes before they close. 0
A : What happens if you're late? 0
B : They will wait with the child, of course. But you have to pay extra. -1
A : Have you ever been late? 0

B : No, I just listen to the traffic report and leave earlier if the roads sound bad. -1
A : Is your boss understanding? 0
