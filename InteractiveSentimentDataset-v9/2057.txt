B : No. 0
A : Let me check. Can you open your mouth. Your throat is really red. Just in case I’ll take a swab and send it to the lab. If you have a strep infection we will contact you and I will prescribe antibiotics. Your chest is O.K. and your ears are clear but your sinuses are irritated. Make sure you get lots of fluids and if it necessary, take some over-the-counter sinus medicine. 0
