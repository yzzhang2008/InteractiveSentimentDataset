A : That's terrible. -1
B : This morning, I found some on the kitchen counter. 0
A : That pesticide is toxic. You should be careful. 0
B : I know. That's why I'm wearing a mask. I need to take care of this problem as soon as possible. -1
A : I understand. My parents had an ant problem a couple of years ago. They used that stuff too. 0
B : Did it work? 0
A : Yeah, but it smelled bad for a few days. They were getting headaches. They came to stay with me. 0
B : Oh, that's good to know. Maybe we will go stay at a hotel for a few days. 1
A : You can stay with us if you want. 1
B : No, that's ok. Carol is so upset because of the ants. I'll take her on a short trip. 1
A : Good idea! 1
