A : Do you have designer to help you look fashionable? 0
B : No I don't. But I always follow the trend. My hair style, my dress, all about fashion. If you want to be good looking, you must pay attention about your performance. 1
A : That's true. But do you spend a lot of money on your dress? 1
B : Not really actually. I prefer making my own dress at the tailor. Because it's cheaper than buying at the boutique, and I can choose whatever model I like. 1
