A : I was just concerned about Sam. He hasn't been himself lately. -1
B : He took the civil service exam and failed. -1
A : That sucks. He must feel depressed. -1
B : Yeah. He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days. -1
A : Why don't we take him out? We can try to take his mind off of it. In the least show him that we're there for him. 0
B : That's a great idea. Why don't you call him? I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else. 1
A : Ok. I'll call you back after I'm done. 1
B : Sounds good. 1
