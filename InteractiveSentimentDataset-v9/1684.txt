A : Hi, are you being helped? 0
B : No, I'm not. I'm interested in some scarves. 1
A : All our scarves are in this section. What do you think of this one here? It's made of silk. 0
B : Hm, it looks nice, but I'd like to have something warm for the winter. 1
A : Maybe you would like a heavy wool scarf. How about this one? 1
B : I think that's what I want. How much is it? 1
A : It's...seventy-five dollars plus tax. 0
B : It's a little expensive. Do you think it's possible to get a discount? -1
A : Hm, since you like it so much, how about a 10 percent discount. That's the best I can offer. 1
B : That's good. Could you wrap it up for me? 1
A : Sure. Is there anything else I can get for you? 1
B : No, that should be it. Thank you. 1
