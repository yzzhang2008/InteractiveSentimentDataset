B : He said he couldn't find them. -1
A : Is he in trouble? 0
B : Of course he's in trouble. He doesn't get to play video games for each book that is late. -1
A : That's five weeks. 0
B : Yes. That's his punishment. He needs to learn not to hide letters that come in the mail. He also needs to learn to clean his room, so things don't get lost. -1
